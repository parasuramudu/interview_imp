Here's how the scenario you mentioned might play out over four years:

Year 1:

Understanding the Landscape: As a new DevOps engineer, you would start by familiarizing yourself with the existing systems, infrastructure, and the patching/update processes in place.You would collaborate closely with the patching team to understand their workflows and challenges.

Process Optimization: Using your expertise in automation and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), you might start by identifying manual or repetitive tasks in the patching process that could be automated. You could introduce tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or other configuration management tools to help streamline these tasks.

Year 2:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): You might introduce Infrastructure as Code practices, creating templates that define the infrastructure's configuration. This enables you to maintain consistent environments and easily replicate them, making updates and patching more efficient.

Monitoring and Alerts: You could enhance the monitoring and alerting systems, ensuring that the team gets real-time notifications about system vulnerabilities, patch availability, and any potential issues.

Year 3:

Security Integration: Given the importance of security updates, you might work on integrating security scans and vulnerability assessments into the deployment pipeline. This would help the team identify security risks early in the process.

Collaboration: Over time, you would likely establish better collaboration between the development, operations, and patching teams. This could involve regular meetings, shared documentation, and cross-training to ensure a holistic understanding of the system.

Year 4:

Continuous Improvement: By now, you would have several cycles of updates and patches behind you. You'd use the insights gained to continually refine the processes. This might involve gathering metrics, analyzing performance, and seeking feedback from the team to identify areas for improvement.

Mentoring and Leadership: With your experience, you might take on a mentoring role for newer members of the DevOps team or even take on a leadership position. This would involve guiding them through the processes you've established and sharing best practices.

Remember that the specifics can vary greatly depending on the organization's size, industry, technology stack, and more. However, the general trajectory involves gradually optimizing and automating the patching and update processes, strengthening collaboration, and prioritizing security throughout the journey.
