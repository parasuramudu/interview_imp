loops
-----
1.count based loops, mostly work with list
2.for each loop, works with map usually

create 2 public subnets and 2 privete subnets

high availability , we have to consider 2 azs

for each loop:
-------------
task is to create two private subnets

variables:
----------
1. default values through variables.tf
2. values through terraform.tfvars
3. through command line
 
users can always override existing default values in variabkes.tf

always value from the command line will take the priority --> -var="vpc-cidr=10.2.0.0./16"
then terraform.tfvars
then variables.tf
then enter the value

state and remote state:
-----------------------
tf files = declared configuration
state file = actual configuration created by terraform

declared configuration = actual configuration

if you keep the state file in local,there is a chance of creating duplicated infra

1.in a collabaration env, to avoid duplicate infra and errors we will use remote state
2.keeping state in local may be deleted or changed ,restoring it manually is very difficult.
Q) what is the state and remote state in terraform.?

Outputs
Data sources
Locals

outputs:
--------
outputs are useful to print the output values of resources

locals:
-------
locals can run some functions or expressions and it stores the values.

Q) what is the defferent between locals and variables?
     
in a variable we can declare the variable and  values 	and locals also we can declare the name and values 

locals some more capabilities we can run fuctions as well as expressions

data source:
------------
if you want some information from providers,you can query your providers and fetch the data.

i want to fetch AMI IDs from aws dynamically

1.fetch the data of existing resources
2.fetch data of provider information
