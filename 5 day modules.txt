DRY --> don't repeat yourself

1.don't hardcode
2.centralised place
3.validations, you are enforcing some standards

min code and max work
100 lines of code to do one work -->bad
10 lines to do same work --> good

write one common code,parameterise it 
      you can follow best standards and ask all to use that less code,change here it will be                          
automatically reflected in all projects

all teams can use same code with diff variables

1000 project their own code... you need to update all 1000 projects
