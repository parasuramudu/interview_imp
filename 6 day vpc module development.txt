vpc module development
-------------------
DRY:
---
1.centralised code to implement best standards
2.you no need write code from scratch again and again

VPC:
---
vpc 
igw
2 public subnets
2 private subnets
2 database subnets
public ,private, and database route tables
associations
eip
nat gatway

user can select any region ,but we want 1a and 1b az

use locals,data source and functions  concept to get az details automatically

 azs_names = ["ap-south-1a","ap-south-1b","ap-south-1c",]
0,1,2

terraform slice function:
-------------------------
slice(list,startindex,endindex)
slice(az_names,0,2)
ap-south-1a

public subnet --> project-A-public-1a,project-A-private-1b

ap-south-1a --> 1a = using split - and get the last element
ap-south-1b -->1b

split_list = [
      + "ap",
      + "south",
      + "1a",
    ]  
now got last elements:
last_element = [
      + "1a",
      + "1b",
    ]
